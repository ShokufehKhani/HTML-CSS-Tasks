                    Sunflowers are known for their bright yellow petals and their tendency to follow the sun's movement across the sky, a phenomenon known as heliotropism. They symbolize warmth, positivity, and loyalty. In addition to their beauty, sunflowers are also valued for their seeds and oil, making them a symbol of nourishment and provision.
